# Research_Internship_Portal

Our project aims to simplify the process of research internship management by implementing a portal for indirect communication between professors and students. It encourages students to take up projects according to their interests and tries to match them with professors, ensuring maximum satisfaction for both students and professors through least regret algorithm.

## Basic Functions of Portal

- Registers professors and allows them to upload their project details (Professors are encouraged to submit more than one project proposal to maximise chances of a student being assigned to them.)
- Registers students, allows them to choose projects and upload relative ranking of projects chosen
- Provides professors a list of students who have chosen their projects
- Allows professors to rank the students in order of merit and suitability to project
- Uses least regret algorithm on professors’ ranking of students and students’ ranking of projects to match students with projects

## Objectives (specific to NITK)

- Introduces a summer internship program for first/second year B.Tech. students at NITK Surathkal to increase their knowledge in their areas of interest and give them exposure at a very early stage in their careers
- Makes research internship management easy and efficient by making it online
- Encourages interaction between students and professors of respective departments
early on
- Introduces freshers and sophomores to research culture at NITK

## Execution Instructions:
